You decide to bide your time.When it came time for Ms. Wang to unwrap the presents, she liked the kitten you got very much, and Mr. Wang was very happy about it. He called you and hoped that you could work for him in the future.

You have become Mr. Wang's subordinate, but Mr. Wang has countless subordinates. What you can do, his other subordinates can also do. And he knows all about his former subordinates, and after investigating your background, he realized that you have hatred for Tiger Claw Gang, and the purpose of approaching him was not pure.

After days of waiting, your chance finally arrives. You've been approached by a street thug who claims to be from the Tiger Claw Gang and wants you to help him get an animal known as "The Cat".

You and Jones became partners. After a few days of getting along, you gradually become more and more close. One day he said he had found his way into the Tiger Claw Gang.

Jones: "My previous employer found out that the management of the largest casino in our area recently celebrated his daughter's 10th birthday. It is said that the operator behind this casino is Tiger Claw Gang. We can learn from this. Let's start."

You: "Great, I heard that Mr. Wang, the manager of the casino, is very cautious, but he loves his daughter very much. We can start with his daughter's birthday present. People have been bringing rare gifts for the daughter. We need a suitable candidate."

Jones: "In this way, one of us will confirm the candidate, and the other will be responsible for finding out what the little lady likes."

You follow Jones out of the bar and into a dark alley next to it.

Jones: "Dude, are you starving? We only drank in the bar."

You: "Yeah, I happen to be a little hungry."

Jones: "It's a pity."

You: "What a pity?"

Jones: "It's a pity you can't eat that ramen anymore."

You feel your body falling to the ground uncontrollably. Your eyelids are getting heavier and heavier, and you see jone walking towards you step by step. He laughed and said, "Don't blame me buddy, if you want to blame it, blame you for being naive..Trying to turn you over to the Tiger Claw Gang guys, but you're so annoying that you keep blah blah blah. I don't. . .''
You lose consciousness.

You are not familiar with the place here, and the gang you want to investigate, the Tiger Claw Gang, is very famous in the local area. Almost everyone who hears that you want to investigate the Tiger Claw Gang thinks you are crazy. But luckily you ran into a fellow non-local at a local bar, a solo player who has been in Night City for ten years, and he seemed interested in what you mentioned. But when you asked about his purpose, he was vague, saying only that it had something to do money.

Jones "You're crazy, but I love working with crazy people, I want to be your teammate.

As a Fixer who came to Night City for less than a month. You basically don't have any network. Plus you have no reputation for the time being. The investigation is not going anywhere. You can only wait silently. After days of waiting, your chance finally arrives. You've been approached by a street thug who claims to be from the Tiger Claw Gang and wants you to help him get an animal known as "The Cat".

"Preferably white, that one likes white," he said, "Money is not a problem."

Jones is offended by your statement and looks annoyed. But he calmed down immediately.

Jones "Listen, I hate being judged, but I can forgive you this time."
He twitched his lips as if smiling. He hands you a glass of beer.

Jones "So to celebrate we're a team, let's celebrate at my favorite ramen place, how about it, it's near the bar, my treat."

[[Option 1:OK, man.]]
(text-colour:red)[Option 2:No. You don't want to piss him off, as a Fixer, you're not good at fighting. You have to make sure you don't delay the investigation of the truth because of injuries.]

[[Option 2: Don't rush for a while]] 


:: a week later {"position":"75,1875","size":"100,100"}
You attended Mr. Wang's secret party, and you found out that the so-called secret party is a human trafficking party, where you can find boys and girls of all ages with different looks, standing naked on the trading table with numb eyes. But although this kind of transaction is illegal, it is not uncommon in Night City. So you're not surprised.

Mr. Wang: "If Ms. Monica is interested, you can choose whatever you want. I will pay for them. They are special products."

You ask "Special?"

Mr. Wang: "They have special chips implanted in their bodies, and they will meet all the requirements of the owner."

You suddenly remembered that your mentor was transcoding some special chips before his disappearance.
You: "I'm curious where these chips come from. You know that being a Fixer is always obsessed with some special merchandise."

Mr. Wang: "This is not something I know much about. It is said that it was introduced by Mr. Shun Oguri from the Eastern District. But at my level, I can't get in touch with management like Mr. Shun Oguri."

You know you're in the right direction, and the next step is to find a way to get in touch with the legendary Mr. Shun Oguri.

You give the cat over to the bastard and he's happy. At this time, you proposed that you want to go to the birthday party with him, and he hesitated for a while and agreed.
"You are very capable. This cat is not something that ordinary people can get. Maybe when Mr. Wang takes a fancy to your ability, you will not be far from getting rich." He smiled and said, "Don't forget about me when the time comes. "

[[You were his girlfriend at the birthday party]]

Jones: "Great, now we just need to make the delivery. The delivery location is set at the unloading area of the casino. You can deliver it when the time comes."

You: "Me? Just me, why don't you go?"

Jones: "Some people in the casino know me and have a bad impression of me. It's not good to cause trouble when the time comes"

[[option1：All right]]

:: option1: Agree to the deal, and invite him to have a drink to find out the news {"position":"475,950","size":"100,100"}
You go to a nearby bar and drink a couple of bottles. The customers start complaining to you.

You capture useful information.

The gangster: "Don't underestimate me. My sister is Mr. Wang's favorite mistress. It's this old man who is so rigid that he doesn't agree with me entering the management team. But as long as I can please the lady. Hehe, damn it... old man..." He passed out drunk.

You find his house key card on him, the owner of which you recognize lives in the high-end apartment next door to yours.

You arrive at the loading bay of the casino, and the entire area is dark.
You shouted "Hello, is there anyone, I'm here to see Mr. Zhao."
There was silence all around. You take two steps forward, only to hear two gunshots. The bullet hit your knee. You are terrified.
"There is someone here, the bastard Jones lied to me." A fat middle-aged man came out of the darkness, his left eye was electronic. "Hi Miss Monica, I heard you're investigating the Tiger Claw Gang. That's not a good idea"
You endure the pain and ask: "Who are you! You know Jones?"
He replied, "I'm Zhao Gao. Everyone calls me Mr. Zhao. Poor girl, you shouldn't trust others easily. Jones, a cunning person, told me your plan a long time ago. I can't let people who plot evil get close to Mr. Wang."

Mr. Zhao pointed the gun at your temple and said: "Now, goodbye, Miss Monica, I hope you can learn to put away unnecessary curiosity in your next life."

A gunshot sounded in the empty unloading area.

As a Fixer who's only been in Night City for a month, you don't have any connections. The investigation is not going anywhere. So all you can do is wait. Fortunately, Jones seems to have found the right customer.
Jones: Mr. Zhao is Mr. Wang's assistant, helping him with his personal affairs. He lost some money in another casino two months ago, and he told me that if you can find me a white creature called a "dog" for free, he will be able to Help you with a few good words in front of Mr. Wang. "

But the gangster has found another Fixer at this time. You missed this opportunity. Lady luck has not favored you. For a long time, you have no way of finding the right opportunity.

You and Jones arrive at the loading bay of the casino, and the area is completely dark.
You shouted "Hello, is there anyone, I'm here to see Mr. Zhao."
There was silence all around. You take two steps forward, only to hear two gunshots. The bullet hit your knee. You are terrified.
Turning to look for Jones' help, to find his unsurprised expression

"There is someone here, Jones, you bastard, you didn't lie to me." A fat middle-aged man came out of the darkness, his left eye was electronic. "Hi Miss Monica, I heard you're investigating the Tiger Claw Gang. That's not a good idea"
You bear the pain and ask: "Jones, what's going on, did you sell me out, you bastard?"
Jone didn't answer my question, but turned to the middle-aged man and asked, "Mr. Zhao, I'm here, and the money I owe you will be settled."

Mr. Zhao took out his gun and said, "Of course."
Jones breathed a sigh of relief, a gunshot rang out, and the pain you imagined didn't feel. A loud bang rang in your ears, and you turned your head to see Jones' unrepentant face.

Mr. Zhao pointed the gun at your temple and said: "I will not pursue the money owed by the dead. Now, goodbye, Miss Monica, I hope you can learn to put away unnecessary curiosity in your next life."

A gunshot sounded in the empty unloading area.
